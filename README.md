# Dataset for "Touhou 15🌙" (Stage: Normal, 6-Faced End boss) Using by one of my homwork XD

Welcome to this dataset repository! 🎮✨ This dataset is designed for research on AI in "Touhou Project" 15, specifically focusing on the **6-Faced Pure Fox** stage (Normal difficulty). It is used for my report haha
There are four folders and you can see in the repository~~~

## Overview 📊
The dataset was collected using **Parakit**'s `AnalysisPlotAll` analyzer, modified for frame-by-frame data extraction. It contains **5000 frames** of data for **four different characters** in the mentioned stage. This dataset can be used for various AI experiments, including reinforcement learning, pattern recognition, and more.

## How to Access the Dataset 🔍

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   You can clone the repository to get access to the dataset files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiriusMing/th15-6-end-boss-dataset.git
   ```
   or:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SiriusMing/th15-6-end-boss-dataset.git
  ```

3. **Git LFS**:
   Please note that the dataset includes large files, which are tracked using **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**. To download the dataset correctly, ensure you have **Git LFS** installed:
   
   - Install Git LFS (if not installed already):
     ```bash
     git lfs install
     ```

   - Pull the data after cloning the repository:
     ```bash
     cd th15-6-end-boss-dataset
     git lfs pull
     ```

   This will download all the large files associated with the dataset. 🗂️
